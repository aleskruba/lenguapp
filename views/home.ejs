    We don't want to limit your learning. As long as you and your teacher have the time, you can take as many lessons as you want.

Teachers on Lengua allow you to go at your own pace. If you want to have a quick lesson during your lunch break, 30 minute or 45 minute lessons are ideal. People looking for a longer session, you can book up to 90 minutes!

We also offer lessons for impulsive learners. If you want to learn a language right now, you can book an Instant Lesson and start a trial lesson.
