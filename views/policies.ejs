    <p><strong>Teacher Policy(Last Updated on 31 August, 2020)</strong></p>
    <p>If you want to offer Teacher Services on the Lengua Platform, you must read and agree to be bound by these policies for Teachers ("Teacher Policy"). Capitalized terms (including the term "Lengua") used but not defined in this Teacher Policy have the meanings ascribed to such terms in our Terms of Service, which is available at www.Lengua.com/tos (the "Lengua Terms").</p>
    <p>If you do not accept this Teacher Policy in full, you are not authorized to teach on the Lengua Platform and you are not eligible to receive any benefits from Lengua for any Teacher Services you provide.</p>
    <p>This Teacher Policy is designed to encourage the highest standards of Teacher behavior in their relationships with Students by setting clear expectations, and to provide the principles to guide Teachers in their daily conduct when providing Teacher Services and interacting with Students. However, our Teachers come from all over the world and are thus accustomed to a variety of different cultural norms. As a result, this Teacher Policy attempts to adopt universally accepted standards of respect and tolerance. This Teacher Policy does not attempt to address every potential situation that could arise when Teachers interact with Students on the Lengua Platform, but instead provides principles for ethical and professional behavior that can serve as guidance regarding Lengua expectations.</p>
